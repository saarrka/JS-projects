# Weather App Project

This is a simple Weather App built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app allows users to check the current weather by providing a location (city name). It fetches real-time data from a weather API and displays the weather information, including temperature, humidity and weather conditions.

## Features:
- **Search for a city's weather**: Users can search for the weather by entering a city name.
- **Displays current weather data**: Shows temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
- **Responsive design**: The app is designed to work across various screen sizes.
- **Error handling**: If an invalid city name is entered or there is an issue with the API, an error message is displayed.

## Technologies Used:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- OpenWeatherMap API (for fetching weather data)

## How it works:
1. The user enters a city name in the input field and clicks the "Search" button.
2. The app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the city name.
3. The weather data is then displayed on the screen, showing the temperature, humidity, and weather description.
4. If the city is invalid or the request fails, an error message is shown.
